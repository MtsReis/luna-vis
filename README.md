# "One day we'll know we can't forget" Visualizer

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/IVhOFMa9rAo/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/IVhOFMa9rAo)

Made with [Luna](https://github.com/MtsReis/luna) as a boilerplate

Additional 3rd party libs:
* [Complex](http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaMatrix)
* Lua FFT port (by Benjamin von Ardenne) from KissFFT (by Mark Borgerding)

The branch "export" is available for generating the frames in image files.

## Running it
Some visuals are randomly defined so everytime you run it you'll get a different result.

### Windows
Just download the latest (and probably only) [release file](https://github.com/MtsReis/luna-vis/releases/download/1.0/luna-vis.zip)

Keep in mind that the resolution is locked at 1920Ã—1080. Scaling and controls of a cropped vision were removed for the final result.
